               <p>This application demonstrates a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) architecture.
               SPAs are for an improved user experience. A SPA avoids interruption of the user experience between
                   successive pages, making the application behave more like a desktop application.
                   This application is created with the <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>&nbsp;
                   and <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/" target="_blank">React Bookstrap</a> libraries.</p>
               <p>This application is an API client. Data of the application is provided by a API service called <strong>MyCollege API</strong>.
                   The application uses four common HTTP methods for CRUD operations: <strong>GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE</strong>.
               </p>
               <p>This application uses three different approaches for making API calls:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest" target="_blank">XMLHTTPRequest</a> </li>
                   <li><a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank">Axios</a></li>
